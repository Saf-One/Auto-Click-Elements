## LLM Context Points
- The extension uses a content script to interact with web pages
- Element selection uses visual highlighting for user feedback
- CSS selectors are generated to identify elements across page loads
- MutationObserver is used to handle dynamically loaded content
- Chrome storage API persists user selections per domain
- Comprehensive logging system covers all extension operations
- Logger provides different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Performance timing captures execution time of critical operations
- Logs are stored in chrome.storage and can be exported as JSON
- UI provides filtering and management of logs

## Future Improvements Roadmap
1. Add sequence support for ordered clicking
2. Implement delay configuration between clicks
3. Add conditional clicking based on page state
4. Improve selector generation algorithm
5. Add export/import functionality for settings backup
6. Enhance UI with better visual feedback
7. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
8. Implement click verification to ensure actions completed
9. Add log retention policies and rotation
10. Implement log analytics and visualizations 

## Notes
- Current selector generation is basic and may not work for all complex DOM structures
- The extension requires permission to read and modify website content
- Performance impact should be monitored on complex pages
- Future versions should consider handling iframes and shadow DOM
- The logging system provides detailed insights for debugging but may impact performance if excessive debug logs are enabled
- Consider implementing log compression for long-term storage
